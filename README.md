# trading-system

Program is not finished. Part missing are:
- A user needs to be able to accept a trade request.
- A user needs to be able to deny a trade request.
- A user needs to be able to browse completed requests.

Not finished due to hinderance and unforseen distraction that gave me less time to work in this than i thought i would have.
Some code comments are also missing due for this reason. I hope there still enough to help understand what i have written
and why i went with the approached i did.
